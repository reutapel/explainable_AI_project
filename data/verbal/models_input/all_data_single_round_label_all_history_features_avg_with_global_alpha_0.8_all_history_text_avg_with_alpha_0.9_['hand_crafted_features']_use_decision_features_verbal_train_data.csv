The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception. The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty. I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels. Overall disgusting. They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel.,1

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day.

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax. Positive: Trams passed the front door. Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around.

Negative: The hotel is terrible they advertise for AC which does not work in the entire building although it was 26 degrees. As the owner do not want to run it. The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception. The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty. I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels. Overall disgusting. They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel.,1

Negative: Rooms were tired. Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine.

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair. Positive: Location is beyond fabulous. View from our 4th floor room was incredible. Parking is not a problem.

The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: The location is awesome. You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot.,-1

Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair.",1

Breakfast was slightly overpriced but you did have a fantastic selection.",-1

The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception. The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty. I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels. Overall disgusting. They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel.,-1

Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around. Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09:00. Negative: Rooms were tired. Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,-1

We spent time in the spa and on the roof terrace which has spectacular views over the city very close to the metro so getting about was easy I will return here I hope sometime in the future.,-1

Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around. Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09:00. Negative: Rooms were tired. Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,-1

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair. Positive: Location is beyond fabulous. View from our 4th floor room was incredible. Parking is not a problem.

Good wifi, location to the metro was excellent not so many bars restaurants nearby but easy to travel into central Barcelona. Room was spacious.

Negative: No tea coffee making facilities in the room but we knew that when we booked. I'm a typical Brit who likes her Tea.

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,-1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,1

They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel.,1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,1

The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy.

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,-1

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day.

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around. Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09:00. Negative: Rooms were tired. Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

It is quite easy to get metros and there are lots of bakeries and eateries nearby. Negative: The hotel is easy to miss as you walk on the street so keep eye out. The rooms are very compact and there is not real privacy when you are in the bathroom as there is not a locking door between the room and bathroom. We also noticed our carpets were not vacummed in the room.,1

The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception. The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty. I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels. Overall disgusting. They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel.,-1

Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful.

You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,-1

Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax. Positive: Trams passed the front door. Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around. Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09:00.,-1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair. Positive: Location is beyond fabulous. View from our 4th floor room was incredible. Parking is not a problem.

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

They also upgraded us as a surprise for my husbands birthday we had the most awesome views and the room was perfect, we woke up to see the sunrise. our stay was simply perfect and very recommended. I recently stayed at the Mondrian hotel priced almost the same for the room categories but in terms of service experience attention to detail and customer satisfaction this hotel by FAR exceeded that experience so much so we joined up to Shangri la's loyalty program as I was really surprised we could still get such amazing customer service. Fully recommend staying here did I mention the phenomenal views. Negative: Nothing not to like.",1

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,-1

You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy.

Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax. Positive: Trams passed the front door. Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around.

Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy.

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax. Positive: Trams passed the front door. Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around.

You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,-1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair. Positive: Location is beyond fabulous. View from our 4th floor room was incredible. Parking is not a problem. Being able to fall asleep at night to the sound of the ocean is a must for everyone.",1

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,-1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: The location is awesome. You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot.,1

Thank you so much for being so kind and helpful.,1

The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful.

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,-1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,-1

The rooms are very compact and there is not real privacy when you are in the bathroom as there is not a locking door between the room and bathroom. We also noticed our carpets were not vacummed in the room.,-1

In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: The location is awesome. You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot.,-1

Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine.

I can not speak highly enough of everyone who made our stay so special. Our room was lovely and clean with a fantastic shower and huge comfy bed. We spent time in the spa and on the roof terrace which has spectacular views over the city very close to the metro so getting about was easy I will return here I hope sometime in the future.

As the owner do not want to run it. The room telephones are not even connected not even to call reception. The bathroom bath was incredibly dirty. I took pictures never seen this in my entire travels. Overall disgusting. They hotel looks like it got stuck in the 70's and never moved on. Completely obsolete. A disaster never stay there really. How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel. Positive: Nothing.,1

You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful. Negative: The swimming pool on the top of the roof is very small. In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer.,1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: The location is awesome. You can go across the street and grab a subway. The Sagrada Familia is about 15 20 minutes by foot.,1

How can even booking com have this hotel on its list is a big question mark. That hotel should not even trade. Or Maybe as a hostel. Positive: Nothing.,1

The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day.

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,1

View from our 4th floor room was incredible. Parking is not a problem. Being able to fall asleep at night to the sound of the ocean is a must for everyone. Negative: These are not deal breakers but some things that maybe other travelers would like to know. Rooms are very basic no hair dryer no mini fridge no face clothes no top sheet on the bed we got very warm having to use only the duvet, having said all that we got by just fine. I even sported a new hair do for a few days due to towel drying my hair.",1

Attractive foyer. Staff spoke English and gave good guidance to how to get around. Breakfast waitress was very helpful but the selection of food was limited and breakfast finished at 09:00. Negative: Rooms were tired. Carpet needed a good clean or replacement. Plumbing system outdated. Various fittings were missing or knobs had come off. There were about 5 lamps that needed replacing. The tv remote did not work and request for new batteries did not happen. Unfortunately 2 of our party were ill and stayed in their rooms and were disturbed even though we had requested that the rooms were not serviced that day. Nothing to do with the hotel but there is a 10 euro per night city tax.,1

In high season there is little possibility that you will be able to use it. The worst thing was that during my stay the crew started to paint all the walls on my floor's corridor. The paint smell really awful. Although the stuff from the Reception desk was ok the women bartender who worked on morning shift wasn't very nice maybe she felt a little bit sleepy. In my opinion the cost was too high compared to the offer. Positive: Perfect location a few steps from Plaza Catalunya. Balcony room has great view and individual plunge pool option is a bonus. Free snacks and drinks available. Staff were extremely warm and helpful.,-1
