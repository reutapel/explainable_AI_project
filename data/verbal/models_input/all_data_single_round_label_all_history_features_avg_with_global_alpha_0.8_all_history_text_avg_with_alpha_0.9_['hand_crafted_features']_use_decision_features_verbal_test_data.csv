The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room's window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm. So we couldn't take a nap from time to time when we needed it. I have to add that when. I ordered the room from booking they didn't mention that the hotel was under construction. When. I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said. I'm sorry but. I have nothing to do. It will last for 2 more days. Of course the construction works didn't end but continued all week. Also. I wouldn't recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience . Positive: The location of the hotel is very convenient .,1

For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation. If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,-1

Positive: Location and view are key at this charming hotel. For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation. If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored .,-1

Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,1

If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,-1

Negative: The hotel was under construction. The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room's window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm. So we couldn't take a nap from time to time when we needed it. I have to add that when. I ordered the room from booking they didn't mention that the hotel was under construction. When. I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said. I'm sorry but. I have nothing to do. It will last for 2 more days. Of course the construction works didn't end but continued all week. Also. I wouldn't recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience .,1

Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,1

Negative: The hotel allows people to be with their pets. One of the guests left his 2 big dogs in the room and went outside. We were obliged to change the room around 11 pm simply because the hotel weren't able to join the guest by phone. When we asked the concierge about the way the accept people with pets the answer was they are paying extra money for this. This was a ridiculous justification from the hotel. Adding to that there is an adhoc market every. Tuesday. Friday. Sunday in front of the hotel from 5 am until 3 pm with the noise and the dust everywhere in the road .,1

Positive: Location and view are key at this charming hotel. For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation. If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored .,-1

Negative: The hotel was under construction. The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room's window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm. So we couldn't take a nap from time to time when we needed it. I have to add that when. I ordered the room from booking they didn't mention that the hotel was under construction. When. I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said. I'm sorry but. I have nothing to do. It will last for 2 more days. Of course the construction works didn't end but continued all week. Also. I wouldn't recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience .,1

For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation. If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,1

The rooms are bright with wide windows as I expected. Cosy . Negative: It was kind of uncomfortable to have a sink inside the room rather than bathroom.

Negative: The hotel was under construction. The room we got was in the 6th floor while the 5th floor was closed and right beneath our room's window there was drilling knocking and generally a lot of noise during early morning hours up until 5 30 pm. So we couldn't take a nap from time to time when we needed it. I have to add that when. I ordered the room from booking they didn't mention that the hotel was under construction. When. I asked the receptionist what can be done about it he said. I'm sorry but. I have nothing to do. It will last for 2 more days. Of course the construction works didn't end but continued all week. Also. I wouldn't recommend taking a room with a double bed since it was a back breaking experience .,1

Negative: The hotel allows people to be with their pets. One of the guests left his 2 big dogs in the room and went outside. We were obliged to change the room around 11 pm simply because the hotel weren't able to join the guest by phone. When we asked the concierge about the way the accept people with pets the answer was they are paying extra money for this. This was a ridiculous justification from the hotel. Adding to that there is an adhoc market every. Tuesday. Friday. Sunday in front of the hotel from 5 am until 3 pm with the noise and the dust everywhere in the road .,1

The rooms could be cleaner they start to have an older look and could probably get new carpets or no carpets at all which is always the best choice for hotels .,-1

Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored .,-1

For a short visit for tourism or for business in the central city one would hardly need transportation. If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,-1

The rooms are bright with wide windows as I expected. Cosy . Negative: It was kind of uncomfortable to have a sink inside the room rather than bathroom. Also I was missing simple thing like you even find in 3 hotel body lotion. Instead there is quite a few things like a shower cap which is much less important .,-1

Near the heart of paris. Just a few meters walk to Champs Elysses and Arc de triomphe de I Etoile. There is a good Iranian restaurant just a few meters from the hotel on rue Washington. The staff was very very friendly. They were very helpful to us to find our lost luggage on the airfrance flight. The backyard garden is very cousy and calm. You can relax and enjoy the shadow of trees there. Rooms that have view to the street are so large and have balcony . Negative: There are two lifts but they are slow. There were no many variety on the breakfast table. The couch for seating in breakfast hall is not suitable for the table .,1

If you do a taxi stand is just beyond the door and just past that a stop for the Metro Need RER. The station for line to CDG is two steps right of the entrance. Rooms are beautifully quiet and peaceful. The courtesy of the staff can't be surpassed. Add little kindnesses like providing good umbrellas for rainy days and guests get the feeling their needs are anticipated and honored . Negative:.,-1
